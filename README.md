# MySQL_Ecommerce-Data
This is ksmilda's portfolio: Data cleaning and data exploration using MySQL.

## Project Background 
With this project, I'm analyzes an open dataset obtained from Kaggle (link), which contains simulated e-commerce transactions. The dataset includes customer information, order details, product categories, sales values, and other related attributes. Although the dataset does not represent a specific company, it serves as a realistic sample to demonstrate data exploration, KPI tracking, and dashboard building.
The purpose of this analysis is to showcase data cleaning, SQL queries, and visualization skills for business intelligence use cases such as sales monitoring, customer segmentation, and churn analysis. This whole SQL project was executed on the MySQL Server, below is a snapshot of a few of the columns and entries in the [dataset](https://github.com/ksmilda/MySQL_Ecommerce-Data/blob/312f3babf0d8f275bde012918adf4d978993c4c3/E%20Commerce%20Customer%20Insights%20and%20Churn%20Dataset.xlsx).


## Data Cleaning
Before the exploration begins, the dataset is checked and cleaned to ensure there are no missing values nor duplicate rows, as documented in [this file](https://github.com/ksmilda/MySQL_Ecommerce-Data/blob/56a4d3774fa5f1b81d371230d57f4ffe25ab50cf/data%20cleaning_E%20Commerce.sql). The process include formatting the data type (normalizing) and setting the column "order_id" as the primary key. 

## Data Exploration
1. Numbers of order
2. Total revenue
3. Average order value (AOV)
4. Customer lifetime value (CLV)
5. Numbers of active customers
6. Churn rate (and every country's)
7. Average age of customers
8. Total orders (per country)
9. Revenue per country
10. Top 5 product based on revenue
11. Average purchase frequency by category
